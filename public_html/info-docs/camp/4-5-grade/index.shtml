The specific risks vary from one activity to another, but the risks range from 1) minor injuries such as scratches, bruises, and sprains to 2) major injuries such as eye injury or loss of sight, joint or back injuries, heart attacks, and concussions to 3) catastrophic injuries including paralysis and death. I have read the previous paragraphs and I know, understand, and appreciate these and other risks that are inherent in JMM Spartan Football Camp. I hereby assert that my participation is voluntary and that I knowingly assume all such risks.</p>
